# Overview

This is the beginning of my personal software portfolio as a developer. The project demonstrates the classic "Hello World" output using TypeScript, which reflects the one of the technology stacks I will be working with this semester.

My purpose for this project is to establish a clean and professional workflow using GitHub, Node.js, and TypeScript.
